## Getting Started

Check your development environment! You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) and [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) installed. The official Gatsby website also lists two articles regarding this topic:
- [Gatsby on Windows](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-on-windows/)
- [Check your development environment](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/)


### Building your site

```
npm run build
```

Copy the content of the ``public`` folder to your webhost or use a website like Netlify which automates that for you.

**Attention:** You also need to edit ``static/robots.txt`` to include your domain!
